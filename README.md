# Machine Learning Project Overview
## 1. Introduction
These all are the  machine learning projects that aims to solve a specific problems. In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset and build a model that can make predictions on new data.

## 2. Problem Statement
Described the problem that we are trying to solve using machine learning. Explain why this problem is important and how solving it can have a positive impact.

## 3. Dataset
Described the dataset that we will be working with. Included information about the size of the dataset, the type of data that it contains, and any preprocessing that has been done on the data.

## 4. Approach
Described the approach that we will be using to solve that problems. This should include details about the machine learning techniques that we will be using, such as supervised or unsupervised learning, regression or classification, etc.

## 5. Model Selection
Described the process of selecting the appropriate model for the problem at hand. Explained the criteria used to select the model and justify the final selection.

## 6. Model Training and Evaluation
Described the process of training and evaluating the model. This should include information about how the dataset was split into training and testing sets, the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, and any hyperparameter tuning that was done.

## 7. Results
Present the results of the model evaluation. This should include information about the performance of the model on the test dataset, as well as any insights that were gained from the analysis.

## 8. Conclusion
Summarized the main findings of the project and discussed any limitations or future work that could be done to improve the model.

## 9. Installation
Provided instructions on how to install the necessary packages and libraries to run the code.

## 10. Usage
